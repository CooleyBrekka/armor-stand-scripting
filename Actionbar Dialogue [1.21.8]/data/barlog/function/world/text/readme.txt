How to add more dialogue lines to a character:

- in `script/<character_name>`, add a function file. 
  - `script/amelia/greeting` is a sample file that showcases formatting flags
  - approach the amelia sign in the hub to see how this formatting looks like in-game

- to test a specific line:
  - replace `function cooley:world/text/script/amelia/greeting` in `trigger/amelia_enter` with your function
  - it's not too hard to add more characters and dialogue triggers but i can just make those by request
